# OctoCat
This was our week 1 day 3 assignment.

Our goal was to reproduce the (https://octodex.github.com/ "Octodex webpage") in a responsive way using Octodex images we chose.

This was an `HTML` + `CSS` project, though we learned a great deal about the newly supported flexbox techniques, as well as how to select specific attributes in order to change them.

Simply open `index.html` to check it out!
